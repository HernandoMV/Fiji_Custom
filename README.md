## CZI_SlideScanner_ROIsubdivider
Deals with the huge .czi files produced by Slide scanner. Currently it works for the RNAscope pipeline in CellProfiler_AnalysisPipelines. 
It opens the low resolution image of the selected set of piramidal images, gets the manually-drawn ROI and subdivides it into smaller squared ones, saving the channels separately and saving summary and ROIs.
